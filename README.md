# Simulating PRC2 methylating Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) in *Drosophila melanogaster*

A Monte Carlo model of chromatin as a one-dimensional vector of nucleosomes. 
Each nucleosome has two H3K27 positions, which have 0â€“3 methyl groups. During each simulation step, the algorithm inspects all 
nucleosomes in random order and tries to add or remove one methyl group from every H3K27 position.

For a full description of the model, read the paper.

## Parameters

The parameters are stored in an object in the script. It takes one argument, which is used to name the output file. 

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| nGenomes | Number of replicate simulations |
| nNucleosomes | Number of nucleosomes in the simulated stretch |
| nUpdates | Number of updates to run the simulation |
| deltaT | Adjusts the methylation parameters to the update frequency |
| pDemet | Called kD in the manuscript. The probability of demethylation |
| k01 | Methylation rate for adding the first methyl group |
| k12 | Methylation rate for adding the second methyl group |
| k23 | Methylation rate for adding the third methyl group |
| S3 | The allosteric stimulation factor of a tri-methylated neighbour nucleosome |
| preFactor | The general increase of methylation efficience for a PRE-bound PRC2 |
| prePositions | PRE positions in nucleosome indices |
| preStrengths | Called PRE occupancy in the manuscript. Specific for each PRE, and adjusts the preFactor |
| tReplication | The frequency of replication |
| snapshotTimes | The update times when snapshots of the simulated stretch are taken |

## Running the model

The script is run with [the node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) environment, and uses the built-in modules fs and zlib.
epigen uses [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com) to read files. This module was installed with npm, and is included in the repository. 

To run on command line:
    `node epigen.js output_filename`

At the end of a successful simulation the object with the used parameters and the output filename are written to console, for example:

    {
		"nGenomes": 100,
		"nNucleosomes": 10,
		"nUpdates": 57600,
		"deltaT": 0.25,
		"pDemet": 0,
		"k01": 0.00325,
		"k12": 0.001,
		"k23": 0.00025,
		"S3": 3.5,
		"preFactor": 350,
		"prePositions": [
			500
		],
		"preStrengths": [
			0.5
		],
		"tReplication": 5760,
		"snapshotTimes": [
			51840,
			53280,
			54720,
			56160,
			57599
		],
		"fileName": "SimulationData/meXdata_output_filename.json"
    }

The model outputs are written into a gzipped json file in the SimulationData folder. 
The output file is named as `meXdata_{output_filename}.json.gz`.

## Output

The json output file contains:
 - an object with the parameter settings
 - the number of nucleosome halves in each possible state (unmethylated, mono-, di-, or trimethylated) for each update of the model
 - the profile of each simulated nucleosome stretch for each snapshot time
