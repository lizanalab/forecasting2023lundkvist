# Simulating PRC2 methylating Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) in *Drosophila melanogaster*

A Monte Carlo model of chromatin as a one-dimensional vector of nucleosomes. 
Each nucleosome has two H3K27 positions, which have 0â€“3 methyl groups. During each simulation step, the algorithm inspects all 
nucleosomes in random order and tries to add or remove one methyl group from every H3K27 position.

## Parameters

The parameters are stored in an object in the script. It takes one argument, which is used as part of the output file name. 
The outputs are stored in a gzipped file in the SimulationData folder, named as meXdata_{name}.json.gz, where {name} is the input argument.

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| nGenomes | Number of replicate simulations |
| nNucleosomes | Number of nucleosomes in the simulated stretch |
| nUpdates | Number of updates to run the simulation |
| deltaT | Adjusts the methylation parameters to the update frequency |
| pDemet | Called kD in the manuscript. The probability of demethylation |
| k01 | Methylation rate for adding the first methyl group |
| k12 | Methylation rate for adding the second methyl group |
| k23 | Methylation rate for adding the third methyl group |
| S3 | The allosteric stimulation factor of a tri|methylated neighbour nucleosome|
| preFactor | The general increase of methylation efficience for a PRE-bound PRC2 |
| prePositions | PRE positions in nucleosome indices |
| preStrengths | Called PRE occupancy in the manuscript. Specific for each PRE, and adjusts the preFactor |
| tReplication | The frequency of replication |
| snapshotTimes | The update times when snapshots of the simulated stretch are taken |

## Dependencies

The script is run with the node.js environment, and uses the built|in modules fs and zlib.
epigen uses [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com) to read files. This module was installed with npm, and is included in the repository. 

## Output

The outputs are stored in a gzipped file in the SimulationData folder, named as meXdata_{name}.json.gz

The json file contains the object with the parameter settings, the number of nucleosome halves in each possible state 
(unmethylated, mono-, di-, or trimethylate) for each update of the model,
and the profile of each simulated stretch for each snapshot time.
